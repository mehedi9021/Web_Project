<h2>About Me</h2><br>
<p>We’re all on a journey, and we’ve all been down in the dumps before, wondering if what we’re doing is really worth it.
Wondering if what we’re doing is really making an impact.
But, it’s important that we’re always moving forward. This is a lesson that I learned early in life.
I remember I was around 4 years old, and I was learning to ride my bike with my uncle and my father.
Of course, I fell off multiple times while I was learning to cycle, and I remember I one time I  cut my knee pretty badly.
At that point I really just wanted to quit and go home. But, my family told me: “you can’t quit now, you’re almost there. Just try it once more!”
You’ve probably heard that before too, right?
So, I got back on that bike. I didn’t want to, but you just need to power through and face your challenges head on.
Sure enough, that was the first time that I rode that bike without any help.
After that, I was so glad I kept moving forward, and that I never gave up.
Now, that probably wasn’t the motivational speech that you expected when you clicked on this article, but it’s evidence, if you ever needed it, that we can do so much more than we think we’re capable of when we’re spurred on by others.
And that’s exactly why we’ve created this article – we’ve listed all of our favorite motivational speeches here, because we already know how much more you can achieve with a little bit of extra motivation.
So, let’s jump into it.</p><br>

<p>Whether we pull out paper bills or swipe a credit card, most of the transactions we engage in 
daily use currency. Indeed, money is the lifeblood of economies around the world. To understand 
why civilized societies have used currency throughout history, it’s useful to compare it to the 
alternative. Imagine you make shoes for a living and need to buy bread to feed your family.</p>
